# Nequi

Nequi is a semantic, unopinionated, scalable and agnostic (S)CSS framework.

This means:

- It follows HTML5 markup in a _natural way_
- Is fully customizable (styles, content, layouts, etc.)
- Is as small or big as you need it to be (atomic design approach)
- It works with your JS framework/library of choice (Angular(JS), React, Vue, Aurelia, Svelte, etc.)
