### Motivation

UI and layouts are getting more and more **complex and beautiful**.

We don't need to create a whole new library that _only_ excels on performance or is heavily dependant on any framework/library of JS or CSS.

We need to start thinking about **normalizing implementations and making them truly reusable**. We need to be able to create a masonry or bento layout **with few lines of simple code**, nothing fancy.

I will get into this rabbit hole and create a really **simple but meaningful tool** full of all those things we all over-engineered _once_.

I hope you follow along this pathway.
